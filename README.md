# biomechanics_workflow
This repository contains the reduction of the kinematic and kinetics data from
human running experiments for biomechanics research. This was originally done in
Matlab as my very first programming task. After two years, I rewrote this in 
python to confirm that the processing done previously is error free. Although 
the reduced results didn't change, I'm surprised how much shorter the code has 
become.
